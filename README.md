This Natural Language Processing(NLP) project was created to participate in the "Twitter Disaster Detection" competition on Kaggle. Explore Natural Language Processing techniques, data analysis, and model creation to detect emergencies on Twitter.

# Competition Description
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
